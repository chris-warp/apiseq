# Sequencer

This is a small prototype of a MIDI sequencer running as a desktop application.
The original project used Angular and Thrust. It has been updated to use React
for the renderer and Electron for the desktop runtime.

Run the application with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The UI loads the example project from `data/example.json` and allows basic
playback control.
